Personal Information
•	Tran Minh Duc (s3855825):
He was born in Hanoi. He is more likely a patient and calm person based on his look. He does not talk a lot. He is, however, still friendly and approachable. It’s just because he usually prefers to be alone to focus easily on his work. Duc found his interest in IT ever since he was in secondary school. Specifically, during the first time he was introduced to Pascal, he began to like it. However, it was not until he was in the second year of his high school that he began to learn programming. His first project was a Tic-tac-toe game that competed with AI, but he didn’t know how to make the GUI at that time so he still has a long way to go, since study is a whole life journey.
•	Nguyen Vinh Quang (s3817788):
He was born on 23th June, 2000 in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. He is also at times called Edward, or simply just Ed. Quang is keen on playing sports, reading science books, and playing games with his friends during his past-time. Ever since he was in secondary school, he has read research relating to science. However, it was after he finished his presentation about ASIMO robots that sparked his interest in the IT field, to be more specific, it was about AI (Artificial Intelligence). Still, at the moment, he has a long way to go and there are many things he has to learn before realizing his true path.
•	Ngo Nhat Minh (s3838104):
Minh was born on 21st September, 2001 in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. Sometimes he is misclaimed as an Indian due to his look, however, he is 100% Vietnamese. Minh is keen on playing video games and sports, hanging out with his friends and chit-chatting. The most interesting thing about him is he’s the only one vegan in the team, but, he is also the biggest and tallest in the team. He found his interest in IT when he was in the first grade of high school. 
•	Nguyen Hung Vinh (s3778972):
He was born on 3rd August, 1999 in Can Tho city, Vietnam. He’s also called Arno once in a while, but still, mostly is Vinh. He’s the eldest and also the most introverted guy of the team. Playing games, especially MOBA games and reading books are his favorite hobbies. Due to being an introverted person so he’s usually shy to make new friends, even though he loves it. The first time that he found his interest in IT was when he was in high school. During that time, he has already done some small research about IT fields and was totally struck by them. Later on, he has also realized that he had the ability to do problem solving and get on well with algorithms, and ever since then, he made up his mind to choose to be a Back-End developer.

Team Profile
Minh Duc:
•	Test 1 – Learning Style Test:
Based on this test, Duc is a visual learner, which means he tends to remember things by reading and/or seeing the pictures. He has the ability to imagine and brings everything that he’s learning into his visual picture in his mind. In addition, he also doesn’t like to study in a crowded or noisy place, where he can be distracted easily by the background noises.
•	Test 2 – Myer Briggs Personality Test:
He tends to be an introverted person who would always rather work behind the scene than taking the spotlight. Moreover, he considers himself as a “fixer”, which means he is able to handle problems related to his team’s work whenever it comes up. 
•	Test 3 – Colour Personality Test:
There’s nothing much to say about the result of this test since it’s similar to the Myer Briggs test above. As mentioned, Duc tends to work individually in order to push himself to work as best as he can. On the other hand, it recommends him for being patient and kind towards everyone, and luckily, he already got all of them.
Vinh Quang:
•	Test 1 – Myer Briggs Personality Test:
According to this test and based on the team’s opinion, Quang truly is an extroverted, who has the ability to link his teammates together and form the bonds between them. He is the one and only perfectionist in this team because he wants everything he does to be nearly, or even perfect. However, fortunately, he is lazy every once in a while, and thereby, it somehow helps him to not push himself over his limit. 
•	Test 2 – Learning Style Test:
Quang and Duc share the same learning style, which means they both good at visualizing things that they have learned and picturing them in their head. Quang also is easily got distracted by noise. In contrast, he loves to work in pairs or groups because he wants to get to know others’ point of view and willing to help each other.
 Nhat Minh:
·   	Test 1 – Myer Briggs Personality Test:
Based on the results, Minh somehow is an extroverted, which is totally adverse to his expectation that he is an introverted due to his disapproval in social interactions. He is more likely a logistic type rather than the emotional one.
·       Test 2 – Learning Style Test:
Minh’s learning style mostly is auditory, which means he can learn effectively by hearing. His ideal study environment is classroom, where he can have the ability to comprehend, analyses the lecture and retain the information.
Hung Vinh:
·   	Myer Briggs Personality Test:
The test results reflect nearly 90% accuracy about his character that he’s more likely an introverted, but also sometimes he could be an extroverted because still loves to make friends and widen his social relationship. He focuses on the team’s or social’s harmony, balancing the connection between the participants rather than competing. Even though he is not creative most of the time, he still can be able to support the team’s idea and at times giving the contrast idea in order to make it more reasonable.
Group Processes
•	In terms of Assignment 2, in general, we did our best so we are pretty confident about each aspect of the assignment even though we are usually on the go with our other courses. By communicating each other frequently and providing supports and contrast ideas towards the members, the bond between the members are strengthen day by day since our working time are always surrounded by hilarious atmosphere. We all hope that our hard work will pay off in the near future, when the results is released.

•	About the upcoming Assignment 3, so far we have already separated works for the team members and things mostly seem to be on track. Despite our workload is much heavier compared to the previous assignments and at times there are some obstacles, we are always ready and happy to support each other to find ways so as to solve them. We do believe that if we work hard enough, the prototype of our project will be done sone before meeting its deadline.

Career Plans
•	Tran Minh Duc: Chooses Solution Architect as his future career
•	Nguyen Vinh Quang: He chooses the same path as Duc, Solution Architect for his future career
•	Ngo Nhat Minh: He chooses to be a Java Developer for career in the future
•	Nguyen Hung Vinh: He chooses to be a Data Engineer as his career in the future
a)	Similar elements:
It can be clearly seen that there are some similar requirements we have to achieve in order to get a decent job. First of all, it is undeniable that bachelor degree is the most vital thing that we have to achieve for our future career. Such formal qualifications are proofs to show that we are fully equipped with in-depth knowledge to meet the job’s requirements. Moreover, essential-skills which relate to the job should also be sharpened while we are still in the university, alongside with some specific knowledge about other programming languages like Python, Java, C# and so on. 
b)	Differences:
Although there are some relating aspects, we still have our own different interests in the IT field so it is clear that our future path will be separated. To be more specific, there are some minor area in IT that one person may good at it, but others may don’t. Nevertheless, we do believe that each area has their own interest which we can learn something new and intriguing about them and therefore, it could facilitate our career in the future.

Scope and Limits
Honestly, in order to come up with this project, we had to spend the first 3 weeks of the semester to think about it and make comparisons between the other ideas. Finally, we made up our mind to choose this project because we think that this is the most suitable one which can be applied directly for our school if it’s put into use. In general, fortunately that we all take high responsibility for our tasks and work together well without negative arguments so things seem to go on track and are more likely to be completed before the deadline, therefore we can have much more time to adjust and test the project to make sure it is around 80-90% error-free focus on other things. 
As we have mentioned earlier in the Assignment 2, we are planning to create a social-media application specifically for RMIT students, where they can form groups or find their teammates who are suitable for their goals for the assignments and it’s named RMIT Student Network (RSN). Thus, users will use their student or teacher ID as accounts to sign up and log in to the website. Obviously that the users need to fully provide their general information such as full name, ID, major and so on. We have also calculated that there will be thousands of users using the website if it is applied in use in the future, so the website will be deployed on the Heroku Cloud Server. This website provides an appropriate environment for all the students to find their teammates who aim the same targets. To be more specific, it is more likely a combination of Canvas and Facebook. It will contain similar functionalities like Home page, Search bar, Profile Page, Notification and a Group list which has a chat box for students to communicate with their friends. 
However, there are some distinctions about RSN’s features compared to mentioned social media. The first one is the Home section, instead of showing global news or “status”, it will display posts related to the users’ major. During the first time that a user log in to the website, as mentioned before, they will be asked to provide general information, including their major, or in other words, their School that they are currently studying like SST, SBM, SCD or SEUP so that the website can provide relevant post about their major. Moreover, there is a Status section, where students can post what they want, exactly just like Facebook or Twitter, but there is another special function which allows them to public their offer to form or find group for their study-related-works or events, the same thing can also be applied for the groups’ recruitment so as to find their suitable teammates. The announcement about the members’ contribution or who wants to collaborate with them will be shown in the Announcement Box. Subsequently, the bio of the users will be shown in the Profile section, namely date of birth (DoB), name, ID, facts or some small stories about themselves (this is optional). Besides, it also demonstrates credit points and feedback from the team members who worked with them in the previous courses, this is the most important tool to evaluate the attitude of the students when working in groups, users will be given their credit points when they signed up the account, 2000 at the start. This credit point will depend on the students’ contribution and attitude throughout the time that they work with their teams positively or negatively. Nonetheless, for the new students, they can only choose students who have the same point (2000) and their bio.
The most vital part of RSN is to create an appropriate academic environment for RMIT students to encourage their study and take full responsibility while working with their group mates. Whenever a student wants to post a request for joining a group, they have to fully provide  what their goal is (HD, DI for example) and their course code so that RSN can find results that nearly match the student’s requirements. However, the website also has its own function to avoid teammates who have bad attitudes or are lazy participating in the DI or HD groups just by looking back at their current credit point. 
However, RSN is still a prototype and being tested frequently so there are some bugs that need to be fixed. Moreover, we all lack professional IT-related skills so there are some errors we can’t figure out how to solve right now. For instance, we got some trouble while working on github, specifically, at times we pushed our files on the wrong branch of other members. Secondly, we couldn’t find ways to connect our HTML files and make it work correctly or there are errors occurred when we use the CSS. In general, this prototype is just a clear example for the judges so that they can imagine how our project looks like and how it works.
