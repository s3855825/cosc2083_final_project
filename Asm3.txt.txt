Specifically, during the first time he was introduced to Pascal, he began to like it. However, it was not until he was in the second year of his high school that he began to learn programming. His first project was a Tic-tac-toe game that competed with AI, but he didn’t know how to make the GUI at that time so he still has a long way to go, since study is a whole life journey.

However, it was after he finished his presentation about ASIMO robots that sparked his interest in the IT field, to be more specific, it was about AI (Artificial Intelligence).

Group Processes
•	In terms of Assignment 2, in general, we did our best so we are pretty confident about each aspect of the assignment even though we are usually on the go with our other courses. By communicating each other frequently and providing supports and contrast ideas towards the members, the bond between the members are strengthen day by day since our working time are always surrounded by hilarious atmosphere. We all hope that our hard work will pay off in the near future, when the results is released.

•	About the upcoming Assignment 3, so far we have already separated works for the team members and things mostly seem to be on track. Despite our workload is much heavier compared to the previous assignments and at times there are some obstacles, we are always ready and happy to support each other to find ways so as to solve them. We do believe that if we work hard enough, the prototype of our project will be done sone before meeting its deadline.

Career Plans

a)	Similar elements:
It can be clearly seen that there are some similar requirements we have to achieve in order to get a decent job. First of all, it is undeniable that bachelor degree is the most vital thing that we have to achieve for our future career. Such formal qualifications are proofs to show that we are fully equipped with in-depth knowledge to meet the job’s requirements. Moreover, essential-skills which relate to the job should also be sharpened while we are still in the university, alongside with some specific knowledge about other programming languages like Python, Java, C# and so on. 
b)	Differences:
Although there are some relating aspects, we still have our own different interests in the IT field so it is clear that our future path will be separated. To be more specific, there are some minor area in IT that one person may good at it, but others may don’t. Nevertheless, we do believe that each area has their own interest which we can learn something new and intriguing about them and therefore, it could facilitate our career in the future.
